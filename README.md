# Smart_Parking_System
The smart parking system is capable of providing an extreme level of convenience to the drivers. 
It allocates available parking space to a driver to park their vehicle, renew the availability of the parking space when 
the car leaves and compute the charges due. Any driver can connect to a home network of a parking lot nearby and see the 
available parking spaces. The parking space also monitors the car if there is a fire hazard. The parking lot is equipped 
with cameras for security and the types of equipment are solar powered.

Main Features

-->Every parking space in the parking lot has an MCU connected to all the IoT devices. 

-->There are two LED lights connected to a motion sensor. If the motion sensors are activated the LED lights go off which indicates that a car is being parked and by the home gateway, the driver can see the status of every parking spot. And if the light is on then there is parking available. 

-->The smoke detector detects smoke and Fire detector detects fire on the parking space. And if there is a fire hazard, the siren goes off and a Fire Sprinkler and floor sprinkler is activated to put off the fire. Drivers are also informed about this thru the MCU. The fee for parking is shown in an LCD display and a token is generated for the driver.

-->An MCU named Security always runs two webcams for security which are connected to a Registration Server. Smart Street Lamps give light to the parking lot which is powered by solar.
